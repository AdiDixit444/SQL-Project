This is a Social Media Data Analysis project using SQL, where I have retrieved the data, executed queries, and extracted valuable insights from it.
The data utilized includes information on users, photos, videos, posts, comments, post likes, comment likes, follows, hashtags, hashtag follows, post tags, bookmarks, and logins.
I applied queries to retrieve the following useful informations: user location, most followed hashtag, most used hashtag, most inactive user, most liked post, average posts per user, bot detection, users who have never commented, users who commented on every post, users with zero followers, users not following anyone, users with more than 40 followers, and the longest caption in a post.
The extracted information can be leveraged to make impactful business decisions.
